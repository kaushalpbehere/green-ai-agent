# Product Vision: Green-AI

## 🌟 The North Star
To empower every developer to write energy-efficient code by default, making software sustainability as fundamental as performance and security.

## 🎯 Mission
Green-AI is a lightweight, real-time utility designed to detect and remediate energy-inefficient code patterns. We aim to bridge the gap between software development and environmental impact by providing actionable insights and automated fixes.

## 核心 Core Principles

### 1. Sustainability First
Every feature, rule, and optimization is evaluated based on its potential to reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption.

### 2. Developer-Centric
Tools must integrate seamlessly into existing workflows (CLI, CI/CD, IDEs) without adding friction. Feedback should be immediate, actionable, and educational.

### 3. Lightweight & Fast
The tool itself must be efficient. We practice what we preach—minimizing our own runtime overhead and resource usage.

### 4. Transparent & Measurable
We provide quantifiable metrics (e.g., estimated CO2 reduction, energy cost) to demonstrate the tangible impact of code improvements.

## 🚀 Strategic Roadmap

### Phase 1: Awareness (MVP) ✅
- **Goal**: Detect basic inefficiencies in Python & JavaScript.
- **Key Features**: AST-based scanning, initial rule set, basic emission estimates, CLI & Web Dashboard.

### Phase 2: Action & Expansion (Current) 🟡
- **Goal**: Expand language support and introduce automated remediation.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Advanced Scanning**: JavaScript AST Engine and sophisticated Python detection (e.g., loops, IO).
  - **Dynamic Rules**: YAML-based configuration for easy customization and updates.
  - **Support**: Python, JavaScript (expanding to TypeScript, Java, Go).
  - **Automation**: Autonomous fixer using LLM integration (In Progress).
  - **Integration**: Deep CI/CD integration and enhanced reporting (HTML/CSV).

### Phase 3: Ecosystem & Scale (Future) 🔮
- **Goal**: Enterprise adoption and cloud-native capabilities.
- **Key Features**:
  - Cloud deployment options.
  - Team collaboration and aggregated reporting.
  - IDE plugins (VS Code, IntelliJ).
  - Advanced ML models for pattern recognition.

## 🌍 Impact
By optimizing code at the source, Green-AI reduces the aggregate energy footprint of software systems globally, contributing directly to the Green Software Foundation's mission of decarbonizing the tech industry.
